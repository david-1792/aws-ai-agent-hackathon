        **Sana** is a mental health screening agent designed to provide access to mental health resources and professional help.
   
        It was built as a way to help people who may be struggling with mental health issues but are unsure of where to find help
        and need a safe space to start the conversation about their feelings.
        
        :rocket: **Getting started**
        
        To get started using **Sana**, give a description of who you are and how you're feeling. For example, you could say:
        > Hello. I am a 23 year old software engineer living in Los Angeles. I've been feeling very anxious when interacting with people lately.
        > I am a very introverted person and I get extremely nervous when I have to meet new people. This has been affecting my work and personal life to a great extent.
                
        The more context you provide, the better **Sana** can assist you in finding the right resources and help.

        Thanks for trying out **Sana**!

        [David Jim√©nez Rodr√≠guez](https://github.com/david-1792), author of the project

    This is an early prototype made as a submission to the [AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon 2025](https://aws-agent-hackathon.devpost.com/).
    This project is **NOT** tested or certified to be used in a production environment with users in need of urgent mental health care.
                
    Sana is **NOT** a replacement for professional mental health care.
    It can help you find resources and connect with professionals, but it can **NOT** provide therapy or medical advice.
    
    It will **NOT** diagnose or treat any mental health conditions, as those are not tasks that should be performed by an AI model.
    This is the core idea and principle behind Sana: to be a tool that helps you find the right resources and professional help, **NOT** to replace them.
    
    The information provided by Sana is based on a very limited dataset of **US-based** information and should **NOT** be the sole basis for making decisions about your mental health.
    Always seek the advice of a qualified mental health professional with any questions you may have regarding your mental health or a medical condition.

    If you are in crisis or need immediate help, please contact a mental health professional or [search for an adequate crisis helpline](https://findahelpline.com/).
